#Part 1)Why Loops?
# Write 10 print() statements below! 
print("This can be so much easier with loops!")
print("This can be so much easier with loops!")
print("This can be so much easier with loops!")
print("This can be so much easier with loops!")
print("This can be so much easier with loops!")
print("This can be so much easier with loops!")
print("This can be so much easier with loops!")
print("This can be so much easier with loops!")
print("This can be so much easier with loops!")
print("This can be so much easier with loops!")

#Part 2)For Loops: Introduction
board_games = ["Settlers of Catan", "Carcassone", "Power Grid", "Agricola", "Scrabble"]

sport_games = ["football", "hockey", "baseball", "cricket"]

for game in board_games:
    print(game) 

for sport in sport_games:
    print(sport)
	
#Part 3)For Loops: Using Range
promise = "I will finish the python loops module!"

for lines in range(5):
    print(promise)
