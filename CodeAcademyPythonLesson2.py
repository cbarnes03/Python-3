#Lesson 2 Control Flow
#Part 1) Boolean Expressions, identify which statement is a boolean expression by yes if so, and no if not.
#ExS:My dog is the cutest dog in the world.
example_statement = "No"
#1S:Dogs are mammals.
statement_one = "Yes"
#2S:My dog is named Pavel.
statement_two = "Yes"
#3S:Dogs make the best pets.
statement_three = "No"
#4S:Cats are female dogs.
statement_four = "Yes"

#Part 2) Relational Operators: Equals and Not Equals
#1S: (5 * 2) - 1 == 8 + 1
statement_one = True
#2S: 13 - 6 != (3 * 2) + 1
statement_two = False
#3S: 3 * (2 - 1) == 4 - 1
statement_three = True

#Part 3) Boolean Variables
my_baby_bool = "true"
print(type(my_baby_bool))		#this is a string
my_baby_bool_two = True
print(type(my_baby_bool_two))	#this is a boolean

#Part 4) If Statement
# Enter a user name here, make sure to make it a string
user_name = "Dave"
user_name = "angela_catlady_87"

if user_name == "Dave":
  print("Get off my computer Dave!")

if user_name == "angela_catlady_87":
  print("I know it is you, Dave! Go away!")
